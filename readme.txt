Allow customers to like and hide products in your WooCommerce store.

== Description ==

The **Product Like and Hide** is an WooCommerce add-on that allows customers to like or hide products on your store. Customers can easily "like" a product by clicking the like button on the product page.

This feature can be used to create a wishlist, or to simply show which products are the most popular among customers.

Additionally, **Product Like and Hide** also allows customers to hide products that they are not interested in, which can help to declutter the browsing experience.

**Product Like and Hide** helps customers find the products they love faster, and improve their overall browsing experience on your website.

**Important:** This plugin is an extension of the [WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/) plugin and it cannot function independently.
